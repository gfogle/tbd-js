# tbd-js
JS framework for building functional, component-centric web applications

*** Note: This is just a pet project of mine to create a SPA framework that:

1. Navigates by Pages
2. Within those Pages, you construct Components
3. Provides help with common problems like: routing, helpers, perf, etc.
4. Doesn't require additional tools to get started -> babel for jsx transpiles, etc.
5. Doesn't provide several options for doing work -> angular service / factory / provider / value / etc

All of the problems above, I'll solve as I add more functionality to the docs,
which are built using the framework.
